Social web application which allows user to make friends, share posts and send messages.

## About application

This application was implemented as a part of my master thesis. This app was the basis for measurements on optimizing image storage in applications of this type. User profile photos are stored in a relational database as a byte array and photos from user entries are stored on an external server - Azure Blob Storage.
